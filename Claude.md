# Tryst.link Scraper Implementation Plan

## Architecture Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for a high-performance scraper for Tryst.link escort profiles. The primary goals are:

1. Reliably extract contact information from 30,000+ profiles
2. Handle rate limiting, CAPTCHAs, and hidden content ("Show" buttons)
3. Process scraping at scale with parallelization
4. Ensure high success rates (95%+)

## Core Technology Stack

- **Bright Data Scraping Browser**: Primary data extraction technology
- **Python (3.8+)**: Core programming language
- **ThreadPoolExecutor/asyncio**: Concurrency management
- **pytest**: Testing framework
- **JSON/CSV**: Data storage formats

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Scraping Browser Integration
- Set up Bright Data Scraping Browser connection
- Create basic profile extraction function
- Implement "Show" button clicking logic
- Add error handling and retries

### Phase 2: Scraper Optimization
- Add batch processing
- Implement adaptive concurrency
- Optimize data transfer and memory usage
- Add data validation and cleaning

### Phase 3: Scalable Processing Pipeline
- Create a job management system
- Add logging and monitoring
- Implement checkpointing
- Design results storage and organization

## Detailed Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Scraping Browser Integration

1. **Scraping Browser Configuration**
   - Connect to Bright Data Scraping Browser
   - Set up browser automation capabilities
   - Configure headless browser session management

2. **Profile Extraction Logic**
   - Navigate to profile page
   - Handle age verification
   - Solve CAPTCHAs (handled by Scraping Browser)
   - Locate and click "Show" buttons
   - Extract revealed contact information

3. **Data Extraction**
   - Extract profile name, location, and bio
   - Extract contact methods (email, phone, etc.)
   - Extract social media links
   - Clean and validate extracted data

### Phase 2: Scraper Optimization

1. **Performance Optimization**
   - Optimize browser settings for speed
   - Implement request pooling
   - Add caching for already processed profiles

2. **Error Handling**
   - Create exponential backoff retry mechanism
   - Handle specific error types (network, CAPTCHA, parsing)
   - Implement graceful degradation for partial data

3. **Data Quality**
   - Validate extracted data structure
   - Fix common issues (doubled URLs)
   - Normalize contact information formats

### Phase 3: Scalable Processing Pipeline

1. **Job Orchestration**
   - Create batch processing system
   - Implement resumable jobs
   - Add progress tracking
   - Design job distribution across workers

2. **Monitoring and Analytics**
   - Track success/failure rates
   - Measure throughput and performance
   - Create alerting for issues

3. **Storage and Output**
   - Design efficient data storage format
   - Implement incremental results saving
   - Add data export capabilities (CSV, JSON)

## Implementation Timeline

- **Phase 1**: 1-2 days - Core scraping functionality
- **Phase 2**: 1-2 days - Performance optimization and error handling
- **Phase 3**: 1 day - Scaling and production readiness

## Success Metrics

- 95%+ success rate for profile extraction
- Capable of processing 30k profiles in <24 hours
- Reliable extraction of hidden contact information
- Minimal maintenance requirements
